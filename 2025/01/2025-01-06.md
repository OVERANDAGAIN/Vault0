In this section, we present the proposed method PTGM, utilizing the pre-trained goal-conditioned policy $P_{\phi}(a_t|s_t, s^g)$ to provide temporal abstractions for RL in downstream tasks. In RL, we train a high-level policy $\pi_{\theta}(s^g|s_t)$ which outputs a goal state to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy $P_{\phi}$ to act in the environment for $k$ steps. To enhance the sample efficiency and stability of RL, we propose a goal clustering method and a pre-trained goal prior model. Figure 1 gives an overview of PTGM.
