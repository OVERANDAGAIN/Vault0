1. “Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA)”2018
   >as a method for controlling the learning dynamics of opponents in a game.
   >A LOLA agent assumes the opponents are naive learners and differentiates through a one step look-ahead optimization update of the opponent. More formally, LOLA maximizes $V^1(\theta^1, \theta^2 + \Delta\theta^2)$ where $\Delta\theta^2$ is a naive learning step in the direction that maximizes the opponent’s value function $V^2(\theta^1, \theta^2)$.

### **Necessity of M-FOS Self-Play**

#### **Background**
In multi-agent learning, **self-play** is crucial for enabling dynamic interactions and strategy optimization among agents. However, existing MAML-like approaches face several challenges during self-play:

1. **Infinite Recursion**:
   - MAML-like opponent shaping methods require each agent to differentiate through the learning step of the other agent. This recursive dependency often results in infinite regress, preventing effective convergence.

2. **Initialization and Stability Issues**:
   - Independent learning in **general-sum games** is highly sensitive to initial parameter settings, leading to instability in the learning process.

3. **Difficulty in Nash Equilibrium Selection**:
   - General-sum games often have multiple Nash equilibria, requiring stricter methods to select the most suitable equilibrium.

---

#### **M-FOS Improvements**
1. **Avoiding Infinite Recursion**:
   - M-FOS adopts a **model-free approach**, eliminating the need to model or rely on the opponent's learning rule.
   - Self-play between two M-FOS agents is naturally treated as learning in a general-sum game, avoiding recursion issues entirely.

2. **Meta-Learning-Based Self-Play**:
   - M-FOS uses meta-learning to optimize strategies over longer horizons, capturing dynamic interactions between agents effectively.
   - This method improves stability and reduces dependence on initial parameter settings.

3. **Inspiration from the Tracing Procedure**:
   - The **tracing procedure** provides a theoretical framework for selecting ideal Nash equilibria by assuming a shared Bayesian prior and iteratively updating strategies until convergence.
   - M-FOS draws inspiration from this approach to enable effective self-play while maintaining practical scalability.

4. **Gradual Transition Mechanism ($\lambda$ Parameter)**:
   - M-FOS introduces a transition parameter $\lambda$, representing the probability of interacting with a **Naive Learner (NL)** rather than another M-FOS agent.
   - By annealing $\lambda$ from 1 (interaction with NL) to 0 (full self-play), M-FOS transitions gradually, ensuring near-optimal performance across the distribution of opponents during training.

---

#### **Summary of Necessity**
- **Addresses Methodological Flaws**: M-FOS resolves the infinite recursion issue inherent in MAML-like methods.
- **Improves Robustness and Consistency**: By using a model-free approach and a gradual transition mechanism, M-FOS reduces initialization sensitivity and enhances learning stability.
- **Facilitates Nash Equilibrium Selection**: Inspired by the tracing procedure, M-FOS enables effective selection of ideal equilibria in general-sum games.

The self-play mechanism in M-FOS is a foundational component for achieving long-horizon optimization and dynamic strategy shaping in multi-agent learning.



### **Meta-Value Learning (MeVa) - Summary**

#### **Key Ideas**
1. **Long-Term Perspective in Meta-Learning**:
   - MeVa is a meta-learning framework based on the **meta-value function**, focusing on optimizing long-term strategy interactions in multi-agent environments.
   - By incorporating a discount mechanism, it captures the impact of current strategies on future interactions, providing a consistent framework for complex multi-agent tasks.

2. **Implicit Value Modeling**:
   - Instead of explicitly modeling the continuous action space, MeVa indirectly represents the action-value function through a state-value function, simplifying the optimization process.
   - It avoids explicit higher-order gradient computations, reducing computational complexity and complementing methods like M-FOS.

3. **Opponent-Shaping Capability**:
   - In both general-sum games (e.g., IPD) and zero-sum games, MeVa enables the learning of sophisticated strategies, such as ZD-extortion and dynamic exploitation strategies.
   - By optimizing the gradient of the meta-value function, it captures the long-term interaction effects between agents.

---

#### **Limitations**
1. **Scalability**:
   - For high-dimensional tasks, the reliance on neural networks with large parameters limits optimization efficiency.
   - The current approach struggles to scale to tasks requiring large-scale batch optimizations.

2. **Opponent Parameter Assumptions**:
   - MeVa assumes access to the opponent’s parameters (rather than observing behaviors directly), which might not apply to all real-world environments.
   - Future improvements are needed to support learning based on opponent behavior modeling.

3. **Parameter Interpretability**:
   - Similar to LOLA’s step size $\alpha$, MeVa’s meta-discount factor $\gamma$ lacks intuitive interpretability, and its impact depends heavily on learning rates and strategy parameterization.

4. **Nash Equilibrium Preservation**:
   - Like LOLA, MeVa fails to preserve the Nash equilibrium of the original game, which might lead to suboptimal strategies in complex game scenarios.

---

In summary, MeVa provides a consistent and forward-looking meta-learning framework but requires further advancements in scalability, opponent modeling assumptions, and parameter interpretability to address its current limitations.
