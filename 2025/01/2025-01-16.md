Pre-train the subgoal’s prior model. The subgoal’s prior model $p_{\psi}(g | s^g)$ is a VAE that learns from a set of states that are collected while training opponents. The optimization objective of VAE is :

$$\langle \hat{\omega}, \hat{\psi} \rangle = \arg \max_{\omega, \psi} \mathbb{E}_{g \sim q_{\psi}(g | s)} \left[ \log p_{\omega}(s | g) \right] - KL \left( q_{\psi}(g | s) \| \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \right).$$

The decoder $p_{\omega}(s | g)$ is also used to reconstruct the subgoal state, as discussed in Section 5.5.
