1. “Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA)”2018
   >as a method for controlling the learning dynamics of opponents in a game.
   >A LOLA agent assumes the opponents are naive learners and differentiates through a one step look-ahead optimization update of the opponent. More formally, LOLA maximizes $V^1(\theta^1, \theta^2 + \Delta\theta^2)$ where $\Delta\theta^2$ is a naive learning step in the direction that maximizes the opponent’s value function $V^2(\theta^1, \theta^2)$. 
   
2. Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS) (2018)
Variations of LOLA have been introduced to have formal stability guarantees

4. More recent work performs opponent shaping by having an agent play against a best response approximation of their policy (Aghajohari et al., 2024a).

5. LOQA (Aghajohari et al., 2024b), on which this work is based, performs opponent shaping by controlling the Q-values of the opponent using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) estimators.

5. Meta-value learning: a general framework for learning with learning awareness.
Cooijmans, T., Aghajohari, M., and Courville, A. (2023). Meta-value learning: a general framework for learning with learning awareness.
More recently Meta-Value Learning (Cooijmans et al., 2023) parameterizes the meta-value as a neural network and applies Q-learning to capture the future effects of changes to the inner policies.

7. Scaling Opponent Shaping to High Dimensional Games (Shaper) (2024)
   
Shaper (Khan et al., 2024), scales opponent shaping to high-dimensional general-sum games with temporally extended actions and long time horizons. It does so, by simplifying MFOS and effectively capturing both intra-episode and inter-episode information
