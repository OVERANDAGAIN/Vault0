1. “Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA)”2018
   >as a method for controlling the learning dynamics of opponents in a game.
   >A LOLA agent assumes the opponents are naive learners and differentiates through a one step look-ahead optimization update of the opponent. More formally, LOLA maximizes $V^1(\theta^1, \theta^2 + \Delta\theta^2)$ where $\Delta\theta^2$ is a naive learning step in the direction that maximizes the opponent’s value function $V^2(\theta^1, \theta^2)$.
