### Goal Inference Module

* **Input**: Historical interaction **trajectories** of the opponent
* **Output**: **Latent goal** representation
* **Framework**: A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is adopted to map trajectories to latent goal representations.

This module models the mapping from interaction history to opponent intentions via three key probability distributions:

* **Posterior distribution** $q_\phi(\hat{g}_t \mid \tau_t, s_t)$:
  Estimated by the **encoder** network;  infer latent goal $\hat{g}_t$ based on  trajectory $\tau_t$ and state $s_t$.

* **Likelihood distribution** $p_\gamma(s_t \mid \hat{g}_t, \tau_t)$:
  Output by the **decoder** network;  reconstruct the current state $s_t$ from the inferred latent goal $\hat{g}_t$.

* **Prior distribution** $p_\psi(\hat{g}_t \mid s_t^g)$:
  Generated by a **pretrained VAE**; predicts likely goals based on target-specific features $s_t^g$.

The objective function: maximize the log-likelihood while minimizing the KL divergence between the posterior and prior:

$$
\langle \hat{\gamma}, \hat{\phi} \rangle = \arg \max_{\gamma, \phi} \, \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\hat{g}_t \mid \tau_t, s_t)} \left[ \log p_\gamma(s_t \mid \hat{g}_t, \tau_t) \right] - \text{KL} \left( q_\phi(\hat{g}_t \mid \tau_t, s_t) \,\|\, p_\psi(\hat{g}_t \mid s_t^g) \right)
$$

### ✅ Slide 6: **Full Framework Overview**

**Slide Title**:
**HOP+: Hierarchical Opponent Modeling with Goal Reasoning**

---

**Slide Content**:

🧠 **Main Components** (modular view):

1. **Goal Inference Module (CVAE)**
   🔸 Infers latent goal $g \sim q_\phi(g \mid \tau, s)$ from short opponent trajectory
   🔸 Prior $p_\psi(g \mid s)$ provides training regularization

2. **Planning Module (MCTS)**
   🔸 Simulates future interactions using inferred opponent goals
   🔸 Computes action values $Q(s, a_i, g_{-i})$
   🔸 Agent selects action via Boltzmann over value estimates

3. **Policy Module (Goal-conditioned)**
   🔸 Learns low-level actions conditioned on agent’s state and goal
   🔸 Optimized via interaction trajectories

📊 **Workflow Pipeline**:

```
Opponent Trajectory → Goal Inference → MCTS Planning → Action Selection
                                              ↓
                                        Goal-conditioned Policy Update
```

**Optional Visual**:

* 每个模块旁边加上标注：input/output 简介

**Script (what to说)**:

> This slide presents the **full framework** of HOP+, which integrates goal inference, planning, and learning in a hierarchical structure.

> First, the **Goal Inference Module** uses a CVAE to infer latent goal embeddings based on observed opponent behavior. These goals reflect the **intended sub-objectives** that opponents are likely pursuing.

> Then, these inferred goals are used in the **MCTS-based Planning Module**, where we simulate possible opponent behaviors and evaluate different responses. Instead of relying on predefined rewards or rule-based heuristics, our planner reasons in the latent goal space.

> Finally, we use a **goal-conditioned policy** to execute the selected action, and also update this policy based on rollout results.

> The hierarchical separation of goal inference, planning, and execution allows our method to maintain **interpretability**, **sample efficiency**, and **generalization ability** across different opponents and environments.
