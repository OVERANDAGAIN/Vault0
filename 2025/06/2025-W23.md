目标推理模块：
* **Posterior distribution** $q_\phi(\hat{g}_t \mid \tau_t, s_t)$:
  Estimated by the **encoder** network;  infer latent goal $\hat{g}_t$ based on  trajectory $\tau_t$ and state $s_t$.

* **Likelihood distribution** $p_\gamma(s_t \mid \hat{g}_t, \tau_t)$:
  Output by the **decoder** network;  reconstruct the current state $s_t$ from the inferred latent goal $\hat{g}_t$.

* **Prior distribution** $p_\psi(\hat{g}_t \mid s_t^g)$:
  Generated by a **pretrained VAE**; predicts likely goals based on target-specific features $s_t^g$.
