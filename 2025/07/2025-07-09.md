Using version ^23.3.0 for gif

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.2s)

The current project's supported Python range (>=3.8,<3.11) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
  - gif requires Python >=3.9, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.8,<3.9

Because gif (23.3.0) requires Python >=3.9
 and no versions of gif match >23.3.0,<24.0.0, gif is forbidden.
So, because cleanrl depends on gif (^23.3.0), version solving failed.

  * Check your dependencies Python requirement: The Python requirement can be specified via the `python` or `markers` properties

    For gif, a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to ">=3.9,<3.11"
