# **Review for “Contrastive Learning as Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning”**

---

## **Summary**

This paper presents a theoretical and algorithmic connection between contrastive representation learning and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL).
The authors show that contrastive objectives can be interpreted as estimating goal-conditioned Q-functions, thereby enabling contrastive learning to function as an RL algorithm itself rather than as an auxiliary tool.
Based on this insight, the paper proposes a simple “Contrastive RL” algorithm, proves its convergence under certain assumptions, and demonstrates empirically that it achieves competitive or superior performance across both state-based and image-based goal-conditioned tasks, as well as in offline RL settings.
Overall, the paper reframes the role of representation learning within RL and provides a clean, generalizable framework.

## **Strengths**

1. **Conceptual clarity and originality** – The paper offers an elegant unification of contrastive learning and goal-conditioned RL, turning a commonly auxiliary technique into a standalone RL formulation.
2. **Methodological simplicity** – The proposed algorithm is straightforward, avoiding target networks, data augmentation, and auxiliary losses while maintaining strong performance.
3. **Comprehensive evaluation** – Experiments are broad and systematic, covering baselines like HER, GCBC, DrQ, and C-learning, with results that consistently validate the theoretical claims.

## **Weaknesses**

1. **Limited ablation depth** – While several variants are tested, key design factors (e.g., negative sampling, embedding scale) are not extensively analyzed, leaving some mechanisms under-explained.
