# Review for “Contrastive Learning as Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning”

---

## Summary

This paper presents a theoretical and algorithmic connection between contrastive representation learning and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL).
The authors show that contrastive objectives can be interpreted as estimating goal-conditioned Q-functions, thereby enabling contrastive learning to function as an RL algorithm itself rather than as an auxiliary tool.
Based on this insight, the paper proposes a simple “Contrastive RL” algorithm, proves its convergence under certain assumptions, and demonstrates empirically that it achieves competitive or superior performance across both state-based and image-based goal-conditioned tasks, as well as in offline RL settings.
Overall, the paper reframes the role of representation learning within RL and provides a clean, generalizable framework.

## Strengths

1. Conceptual clarity and originality – The paper offers an elegant unification of contrastive learning and goal-conditioned RL, turning a commonly auxiliary technique into a standalone RL formulation.
2. Methodological simplicity – The proposed algorithm is straightforward, avoiding target networks, data augmentation, and auxiliary losses while maintaining strong performance.
3. Comprehensive evaluation – Experiments are broad and systematic, covering baselines like HER, GCBC, DrQ, and C-learning, with results that consistently validate the theoretical claims.

## Weaknesses

1. Limited ablation depth – While several variants are tested, key design factors (e.g., negative sampling, embedding scale) are not extensively analyzed, leaving some mechanisms under-explained.

中文译文：


本文在理论和算法层面建立了对比表示学习（contrastive representation learning）与目标导向强化学习（goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, GCRL）之间的联系。
作者证明了对比学习目标可以被解释为目标条件Q函数的估计，从而使对比学习能够直接作为一种强化学习算法运作，而不仅仅是附加的辅助模块。
基于这一洞见，论文提出了一种简单的“对比强化学习（Contrastive RL）”算法，在一定假设下证明了其收敛性，并通过实验证明该方法在状态输入任务、图像输入任务以及离线强化学习场景中都能达到具有竞争力甚至更优的表现。
总体而言，本文重新定义了表示学习在强化学习中的角色，提出了一个简洁且具有良好泛化性的统一框架。

   论文以优雅的方式统一了对比学习与目标导向强化学习的理论框架，将一种常被视为辅助模块的技术转化为独立的强化学习算法形式。

2. 方法简单有效
   所提出的算法结构简洁，无需目标网络、数据增强或辅助损失等额外机制，却依然在多个任务中保持了良好的性能。

3. 实验设计全面
   实验设计广泛且系统，涵盖了HER、GCBC、DrQ 和 C-learning 等多种基线方法，结果一致地验证了理论推断的有效性。

## Weaknesses

1. 消融研究不足
   尽管论文测试了若干算法变体，但对关键设计因素（如负样本采样策略、嵌入维度规模等）的深入分析仍不充分，使部分机制的影响缺乏解释性。
