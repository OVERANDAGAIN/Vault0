* **Presenter**: \[Your Name]
* **Affiliation**: \[University / Institute Name]
* **Date**: \[Presentation Date]

**Script (what to say)**:

> Good afternoon. Today I will present our recent work titled **HOP+**, which focuses on enhancing opponent modeling and planning in multi-agent mixed-motive environments. This work builds upon the HOP framework proposed at ICML 2024.

### ✅ Slide 2: **Background – From HOP to HOP+** *(\~1.5 min)*

**Slide Title**:
**From HOP to HOP+: Motivation and Foundation**

**Slide Content**:

**What is HOP?**

* HOP: *Hierarchical Opponent Modeling and Planning (ICML 2024)
* Designed for **mixed-motive multi-agent games**

 **Core Components of HOP ( Inference + Decision Making )**:

1. **Opponent Modeling Module**
   * Infers latent goals of other agents
2. **Planning Module (MCTS-based)**
   * Computes best-response strategies given inferred goals

 **Why HOP Matters**:

* Effective performance in **self-play** and cooperative tasks
* Strong **few-shot adaptation** to unseen opponents

**Script (what to say)**:

> Our work extends the HOP framework, which models agent behavior in mixed-motive settings by separating goal inference and planning. HOP achieves this through a hierarchical architecture where opponent modeling guides the planning module. However, the original HOP uses a limited goal space and static inference mechanisms. Our work aims to push this further.

### ✅ Slide 3: **Problem Setting & Environment** *(\~2 min)*

**Slide Title**:
**Problem Setting: Mixed-Motive Multi-Agent Interaction**

**Slide Content**:

🎯 **Objective**

* Learn **adaptive agent strategies** in **dynamic, mixed-motive games**
* Enable agents to **model unseen opponents** and **respond effectively**

🧩 **Key Challenges**:

* 🤝 + ⚔️ Mixed motives: agents need to **cooperate** while **competing**
* ⛓️ Dynamic strategies → **non-stationary environments**
* ❓ How to infer opponents’ intent and respond in **few interactions**

🌍 **Test Environment** – *Stag-Hunt Game*

* Grid-based world (6×6, 8×8)
* Agents decide to **hunt individually** (hare) or **coordinate** (stag)
* Rewards depend on **joint actions** and **opponent behavior**

**Diagram** (recommended):

* A **grid world** image showing:

  * Two agents
  * Hares and stags
  * Decision outcomes: solo vs. cooperative

### ✅ Slide 4: **Motivation: Why Goal Inference?** *(\~2 min)*

**Slide Title**:
**Motivation: Limitations of Manual Goal Design**

**Slide Content**:

📌 **Problems with Prior Approaches**

*  **Static goal sets**:
	* Predefined discrete goals are **inflexible**
	* fail to capture **diverse strategies**
* **Manual annotation required**:
	* Goal semantics often need to be designed by hand
	* Handcrafted goals don’t scale well to **unseen opponents**

---
💡 **Our Insight**
>  **infer goals automatically** from interaction trajectories.


🎯 **Benefits of Goal Inference**:

* ✅ **No manual goal engineering**
* ✅ **Continuous latent goal space**
* ✅ **Adaptation to diverse behaviors**
* ✅ **Improved interpretability & planning**

**Optional visual (if space allows)**:

* Diagram comparing:

  * "Manual goal set" (discrete, rigid)
  * "Learned goal representation" (continuous, flexible)

---

**Script (what to say)**:

> In previous opponent modeling frameworks, agents typically rely on a **static set of predefined goals**. These goals are manually constructed, often with limited expressiveness, and fail to adapt when the opponent behaves in unexpected ways.

> Such methods **do not generalize well** to heterogeneous opponents, and they require **significant human effort** to design appropriate goal spaces for each environment.

> To address this, our idea is to **infer latent goals directly** from trajectory data using deep generative modeling. By doing this, we can capture a **continuous and adaptive** goal space that evolves with interaction and requires **no manual labeling**. This provides a more powerful foundation for downstream planning and policy learning.

### **Slide 3: Problem & Environment**

---

**Goal**
Enable agents to adapt in **mixed-motive** multi-agent games
→ Must **infer opponent intent** and **respond effectively**

**Challenges**

* Mixed incentives: **cooperation** vs. **competition**
* Opponents behave **dynamically**, non-stationary
* Limited interactions for **adaptation**

**Environment: Stag-Hunt Game** —— **MSH**

* Grid-based map (6×6 or 8×8)
* Choose:
  * 🐇 Hunt hare (solo, low reward)
  * 🦌 Hunt stag (team up, high reward)
* Reward depends on **joint actions**

---

**📊 Visual (on right)**

* Grid world with:

  * Agents, hare, stag
  * Outcome arrows: solo hunt vs. team hunt

### **Slide 3: Problem Setting and Environment**

---

**Objective**
Learn adaptive strategies in mixed-motive multi-agent environments.
Agents must model diverse opponents and respond effectively under uncertainty.

---

**Key Challenges**

* Mixed incentives: agents must balance cooperation and competition
* Dynamic interactions lead to non-stationary opponent behaviors
* Limited interactions require fast adaptation to unseen strategies

---

**Test Environment: Stag-Hunt Game**

* Grid-based world (6×6 or 8×8)
* Agents choose to hunt hare (individually) or stag (cooperatively)
* Rewards depend on joint actions and mutual coordination

---

**(Optional Visual)**
A simple grid-world diagram showing two agents, one hare, one stag, and outcome labels:

* Solo action → lower reward
* Coordinated action → higher reward
