In game theory, the ==best response== is the strategy (or strategies) which produces the most favorable outcome for a player, taking other players' strategies as given.[1] The concept of a best response is central to John Nash's best-known contribution, the Nash equilibrium, the point at which each player in a game has selected the best response (or one of the best responses) to the other players' strategies.[2]
