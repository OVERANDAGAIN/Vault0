```ad-todo

This paper presents a novel framework called **Quantized Opponent Models (QOM)**, which aims to address the challenge of planning in multi-agent environments where the opponent’s policy is unknown and potentially non-stationary. The key idea is to discretize the space of opponent strategies into a finite set of latent types using a vector-quantized autoencoder (VQ-VAE), and then maintain a Bayesian posterior over these types during online interaction.

The agent constructs a **belief-weighted soft best-response policy**, referred to as the meta-policy, and integrates it into a **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** planner. This approach enables efficient planning under structured uncertainty about opponents, while also offering interpretability through the discrete latent types.

The authors provide both **theoretical analysis**—showing posterior concentration under certain assumptions—and **empirical evaluation** across six benchmark environments, including adversarial and cooperative settings. The results show that QOM consistently outperforms baselines, especially under limited computational budgets, and exhibits robustness to strategy switching and generalization to unseen opponents.

In sum, the paper contributes a compact, interpretable, and tractable opponent modeling method that unifies learning, inference, and planning in a principled way.
