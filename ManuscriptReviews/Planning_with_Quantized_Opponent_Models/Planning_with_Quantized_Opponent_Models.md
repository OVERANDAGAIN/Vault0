# Summary
summary.
Briely summarize the paper and its contributions. This is not the place to critilque the paper,the authors should generally agree with a well-writen summary.
This is also not the place to paste the abstract-please provide the summary in your own understanding after reading.

```ad-todo

This paper presents a new framework called Quantized Opponent Models (QOM), which aims to address the challenge of planning in multi-agent environments where the opponent’s policy is unknown and potentially non-stationary. Instead of maintaining a high-dimensional belief over continuous policy spaces, the authors discretize the opponent policy space using a quantized autoencoder(VQ-VAE). Each opponent policy is mapped to a discrete latent type, and the agent maintains a Bayesian belief over these types during interaction. The agent then constructs a belief-weighted soft best-response policy, referred to as the meta-policy, and incorporates it into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. This enables opponent modeling to be embedded directly into the planning process.

The paper includes a theoretical result establishing posterior concentration under bounded quantization error, and evaluates the method on several multi-agent tasks, including adversarial and partially observable settings. Empirically, QOM is shown to consistently outperform baseline methods—particularly under limited computational budgets—and maintains stable performance when facing switching opponents or policies not seen during training.

# Main Evaluation

Strengths And Weaknesses*
Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, A good mental framing for strengths and weaknesses is to think of reasons you might accept or reiect the paper, Please touch on the folowing dimensions: Quaty, charily, siqnificance,and originalty, For more informationplease see the Neurips 2025 Revilewer Guideines ( htps:/neurips.ccconferences!2025/RevlewerGuideines , You can incorporate Markdown and LaTeX intoyour review, See https://openreview.netfag.
## Strengths
```
The proposed method of discretizing the opponent policy space using a quantized autoencoder is conceptually simple, avoids the need for handcrafted type definitions.

The integration of opponent modeling into the planning loop via a belief-weighted policy prior in MCTS is clean and practically motivated.

The empirical evaluation covers a reasonably diverse set of environments and includes ablations that help isolate the effect of key design choices.

## Weaknesses
好的，以下是与前面风格保持一致、克制且专业的 **Weaknesses** 部分初稿，重点指出方法设计、实验设置和适用性的潜在问题，同时避免情绪化或过度苛责：

### **Weaknesses**

* The approach relies heavily on a fixed offline opponent strategy library, which may limit its applicability in settings where the opponent pool is open-ended or evolving. The method does not support online discovery or adaptation to novel strategies beyond the pre-trained latent types.

* There is limited discussion of the computational cost introduced by belief updates, latent inference, and payoff matrix construction. While QOM is claimed to be more efficient than particle-based baselines, no runtime comparisons or profiling are provided.

* The method is evaluated only with pre-defined agents and policies. It is unclear how it would perform in more dynamic, co-adaptive environments where both agents and opponents are learning simultaneously.

## Suggestions
Limitations*
Have the authors adequately addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work? If so, simplyleave"yes"; if not, please includeconstructive suagestions for improvement. in general,authors should be rewarded rather than punished for being uo front about the imitations of their worsand any potential negative societal impact. You are encouraged to think through whether any critical points are mising and provide these as feedback for theauthors.

## Timeline & Milestones
在在线交互或模拟过程中，我们用一个信念分布 bt(k)bt​(k) 来表示对手为第 kk 个类型的概率。它是定义在 KK 个潜在类型上的一个类别分布（categorical distribution）。


对手历史轨迹 h−ih−i​ 在 rollout 中由环境模拟器 GG 递推重建（对手私有观测不可得，只能推理）。

对手在未能成功标记（tag）智能体之后会切换其策略。这一设定模拟了**分段平稳（piecewise-stationary


在测试阶段，我们部署了一个不在策略库 Π−iΠ−i​ 中的对手策略。
在面对未知策略时，QOM 会自动将其映射至最接近的已知类型，并以此更新信念和策略选择；
