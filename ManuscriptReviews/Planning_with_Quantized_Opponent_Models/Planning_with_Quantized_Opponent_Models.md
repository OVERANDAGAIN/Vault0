```ad-todo

This paper presents a new framework called **Quantized Opponent Models (QOM)**, which aims to address the challenge of planning in multi-agent environments where the opponent’s policy is unknown and potentially non-stationary. Instead of maintaining a high-dimensional belief over continuous policy spaces, the authors discretize the opponent policy space using a quantized autoencoder(VQ-VAE). Each opponent policy is mapped to a discrete latent type, and the agent maintains a Bayesian belief over these types during online interaction.


The agent constructs a **belief-weighted soft best-response policy**, referred to as the meta-policy, and integrates it into a **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** planner. The idea is to integrate opponent modeling directly into the planning loop.

The paper provides a theoretical result showing posterior concentration under quantization error bounds, and evaluates the method across several multi-agent tasks, including adversarial and partially observable settings. Empirically, the method is shown to be more sample-efficient than particle filtering-based baselines, particularly when computation budgets are limited. The results show that QOM consistently outperforms baselines, especially under limited computational budgets, and exhibits robustness to strategy switching and generalization to unseen opponents.
