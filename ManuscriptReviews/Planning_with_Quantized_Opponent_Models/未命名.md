# Summary
This paper presents a new framework called Quantized Opponent Models (QOM), which aims to address the challenge of planning in multi-agent environments where the opponent’s policy is unknown and potentially non-stationary. Instead of maintaining a high-dimensional belief over continuous policy spaces, the authors discretize the opponent policy space using a quantized autoencoder(VQ-VAE). Each opponent policy is mapped to a discrete latent type, and the agent maintains a Bayesian belief over these types during interaction. The agent then constructs a belief-weighted soft best-response policy, referred to as the meta-policy, and incorporates it into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. This enables opponent modeling to be embedded directly into the planning process.

The paper presents a theoretical result showing that the posterior over opponent types concentrates under bounded quantization error, and evaluates the method across several multi-agent environments, including adversarial and partially observable settings. Empirically, QOM consistently outperforms baseline methods, especially under limited computational budgets, and maintains robust performance when facing switching opponents or previously unseen policies.


# Strengths

1. The proposed method of discretizing the opponent policy space using a quantized autoencoder is conceptually simple, avoids the need for handcrafted type definitions.

2. The integration of opponent modeling into the planning loop via a belief-weighted policy prior in MCTS is clean and practically motivated.

3. The empirical evaluation covers a reasonably diverse set of environments and includes ablations that help isolate the effect of key design choices.




# Weaknesses

1. The approach relies heavily on a fixed offline opponent strategy library, which may limit its applicability in settings where the opponent pool is open-ended or evolving. 

2. There is limited discussion of the computational cost introduced by belief updates, latent inference, and payoff matrix construction. While QOM is claimed to be more efficient than baselines, no runtime comparisons or profiling are provided.

3. The method is evaluated only with pre-defined agents and policies. It is unclear how it would perform in more dynamic, co-adaptive environments where both agents and opponents are learning simultaneously.


# Questions

1. How stable is the belief distribution $b_t(k)$ over short time horizons, and when the number of types $K$ is large and closely spaced, how reliably can the model distinguish between them?

2. During MCTS rollouts, how is the opponent’s observation $o_{-i}$ inferred or approximated, given that it is not directly observable to the agent?

3. In the “Adaptation to Switching Opponents” experiment, what exactly does “tag failure” refer to, and how does it determine when the opponent switches its policy?

4. How are the unseen opponent policies constructed in the generalization experiments, and if the training set already covers diverse PSRO checkpoints, what makes these test-time opponents meaningfully novel?

5. The ablation on quantization methods compares several discrete encoding schemes (e.g.,FSQ, LFQ, BSQ), but since the performance differences are  small, what insight is this experiment meant to provide regarding the role of quantization in the overall method?

6. Why is evaluation almost entirely based on performance versus search time, rather than more direct metrics like wall-clock runtime, model calls, or tree size that would better reflect computational cost?


## Limitations

The authors acknowledge some key limitations, such as the reliance on a fixed opponent strategy library and the assumption of piecewise-stationary behavior during interaction.
