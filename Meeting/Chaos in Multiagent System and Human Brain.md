摘要：Chaos theory, as one of the major theoretical breakthroughs of the 20th century, is hailed alongside relativity and quantum mechanics as one of the three great scientific revolutions of the 20th century. Chaos is the last fascinating frontier within classical problems. We have discovered chaos in many areas, including fluid dynamics, celestial mechanics (e.g., the three-body problem), and more. In this talk, we will focus on two areas closely related to AI where chaos emerges: the chaos arising from neural dynamics in the human brain and the chaos generated during the process of multi-agent systems updating towards Nash equilibrium.

Macro and micro phenomena can often be described using similar mathematical languages. We will attempt to define chaos, identify its presence in these processes, and explore a series of emergent questions: Why are the characteristics of chaos sometimes not reflected in current AI systems? How does local chaos lead to macro-level order?
