# Inspiration
the anonymous driving environment may can be used in the HOP.

# Probelms or Thinkings 
1. what is model-based RL?
   >Human beings strive to anticipate future situations to prevent costly mistakes.One naive approach to incorporate this ability into AI is through future trajectory prediction using **model-based RL**
   
   Model-based RL incorporates an explicit module **representing system dynamics,** contrasting with model-free RL.
   examples : **Dreamer** and Model-based Policy Optimizaiton(**MBPO**) 



# Context
**EFT** mechanism $\Longrightarrow$ a social decision-making approach 


# Innovation
predict future observations based on the current state and predicted actions of surrounding agents


# Background
**Counterfactual Thinking** developed $\Longrightarrow$ COMA
howeverm, ==episodic future thinking== remains **unexplored**
leverage inverse rational control **(IRC)**
