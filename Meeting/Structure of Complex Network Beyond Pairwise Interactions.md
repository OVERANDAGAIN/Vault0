Traditional network models typically represent interactions between two nodes, but many real-world systems—such as ecosystems, social networks, and neural networks—often involve interactions that occur in groups of three or more nodes.
New mathematical frameworks that describe these higher-order interactions, including simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, are emerging. These frameworks provide more accurate representations of group interactions, enabling a better understanding of the dynamics of complex systems. How can these higher-order structures help explain phenomena like diffusion, spreading, synchronization, and even evolutionary game theory? How can considering interactions beyond pairwise connections offer deeper insights into the behavior of complex systems?
