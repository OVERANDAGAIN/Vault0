# Inspiration



# Innovation
few-shot adaptation in mixed-motive environments (despite success in zero-sum and pire-cooperative environments)


# Background
1. efficiently adapting to co-players in mixed-motive environments $\Longrightarrow$ hierarchically model co-players' behavior based on inferring their characteristics $\Longrightarrow$ difficulties int efficient reasoning and utilization of inferred information


# Problem



# Methodology
two modules:
1. an opponent modeling module $\Longrightarrow$ infer others' goals $\Longleftrightarrow$ learn corresponding goal-conditioned policies
2. a planning module $\Longrightarrow$ MCTS

updating beliefs about others' goals  $\Longleftrightarrow$ both across and within episodes
information from the opponent module $\Longrightarrow$ guide planning


# Evaluation
superior few-shot adaptation
excels int self-play scenarios
emergence of social intelligence


# Limitations



# Applications
