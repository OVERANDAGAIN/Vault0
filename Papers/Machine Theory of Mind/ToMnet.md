Theory of mind (ToM) broadly refers to humans’ ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. 
We design a Theory of Mind neural network a ToMnet – which uses ==meta-learning== to build such models of the agents it encounters.

1. A prominent argument from cognitive psychology is that our social reasoning instead relies on high-level models of other agents —— such as their desires and beliefs. $\Longrightarrow$ This ability is typically described as our Theory of Mind
2. our ultimate human understanding of other agents is not measured by a correspondence between our models and the mechanistic ground truth, but instead by how much they enable prediction and planning.
