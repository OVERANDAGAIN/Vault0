# Background
All games of perfect information have an optimal value function, $v^{*}(s)$, which determines the outcome of the game, from every board position or state s, under perfect play by all players.

# Theroy
Effective search space can be reduced by:
1. depth of search $\Longrightarrow$ position evaluation; replacing the subtree below $s$   by an approximate value function $v(s) â‰ˆ v^{*}(s)$ 
2. breadth of the search $\Longrightarrow$  sampling actions from a policy $p(a|s)$ that is a probability distribution over possible moves $a$ in position $s$.
