# Inspiration


## Take-away Message




## Inspiration for Us





# Focus
1. we propose ==opponent modeling== based on ==subgoal inference==, which infers the opponent’s subgoals through historical trajectories
2. design ==two  subgoal selection modes== for ==cooperative== games and ==general-sum== games respectively.


# Innovation



# Theroy
As subgoals are likely to be shared by different opponent policies, predicting subgoals can yield better generalization to unknown opponents.


# Background
1. Opponent modeling plays a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and stability of reinforcement learning
