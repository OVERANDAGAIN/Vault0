# Focus
1. PTGM involves ==pre-training a low-level, goal-conditioned policy== and ==training a high-level policy to generate goals== for subsequent RL tasks.
2. pre-trains a goal-conditioned policy via behavior cloning and hindsight relabeling

# Background
==Pre-training on task-agnostic large datasets== is a promising approach for enhancing the ==sample efficiency== of reinforcement learning (RL) in solving complex tasks
```ad-note
The complexity and long-horizon nature of these tasks make it difficult for RL to explore and receive positive rewards, thereby resulting in low sample efficiency.

Pre-training on such datasets to improve RL has emerged as an important research topic.
