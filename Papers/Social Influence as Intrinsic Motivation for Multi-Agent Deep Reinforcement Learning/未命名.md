# Inspiration



# Focus
 - ==coordination and communication== in MARL
 - rewarding agents for having ==causal influence== over other agents’ actions.
 - Causal influence is assessed using ==counterfactual reasoning==

 - Intrinsic Motivation for Reinforcement Learning (RL) $\Longrightarrow$ sometimes in ==the absence of environmental reward==


# Innovation
MOA:
1. only through observing other agents’ actions, 
2. without requiring a centralized controller or access to another agent’s reward function.


# Theroy
About Causal influence:
```ad-note
At each timestep:
 - an agent **simulates alternate actions** that it could have taken
 - computes their **effect on the behavior of other agents**. 
 - Actions that lead to **bigger changes in other agents’ behavior** are considered influential and are rewarded.
```


# Background
1. Empirical results demonstrate that influence leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments, dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more meaningful learned communication protocols
2. In contrast, key previous works on emergent communication in the MARL setting were ==unable to learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner== and had to resort to centralized training
3. Social learning/intrinsic social motivation for RL$\Longrightarrow$ these approaches ==rely on hand-crafted rewards== specific to the environment, or ==allowing agents to view the rewards obtained by other agents==$\Longrightarrow$ make it<span style="background:#affad1"> impossible to achieve independent training of MARL agents </span>across multiple environments.
4. Crawford & Sobel (1982) find that in theory, the information communicated is proportional to the amount of common interest; thus, ==as agents’ interests diverge, no communication is to be expected==
