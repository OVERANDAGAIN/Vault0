About Causal influence:
```ad-note
At each timestep:
 - an agent **simulates alternate actions** that it could have taken
 - computes their **effect on the behavior of other agents**. 
 - Actions that lead to **bigger changes in other agents’ behavior** are considered influential and are rewarded.
```


# Background
1. Empirical results demonstrate that influence leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments, dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL agents, and leading to more meaningful learned communication protocols
2. In contrast, key previous works on emergent communication in the MARL setting were unable to learn diverse policies in a decentralized manner and had to resort to centralized training
